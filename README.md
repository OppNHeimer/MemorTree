# memorTree

memorTree in its current form is simply a feel good page. memorTree will render a unique pixel art tree each time a user refreshes or clicks the page. Each tree is rendered from a randomly generated binary tree so users will never see the same tree twice.

## Getting Started

Visit the [app](https://oppnheimer.github.io/memorTree/)

or

install locally.

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:OppNHeimer/memorTree.git
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

## A little more about memorTree

memorTree was born from the desire to render two seemingly disparate qualities of nature: the uniqueness of all living organisms and the constant patterns in which they grow. memorTree hopes to distill the essence of a cherry blossom tree, and create a minimal experience that gives viewers a feeling of calmness and a space to relax like the trees in nature that inspire the design.

## Technologies Used

memorTree is written in JavaScript and is built with React. While the power of React is currently under-utilized, memorTree is still growing.

## Next Steps

memorTree is a bit clunky and needs an overhaul. It currently renders hundreds of html elements which act as the pixels that make the tree. This approach is not very performant and limits the size of the tree and slows load time. The next refactor will implement a single canvas element and an animation library so that users can watch as their tree grows.

## Long-Term Goals

memorTree is a portmanteau of the words memory and tree. The long term vision of memorTree is to use it as a key visual and motivator in a mobile diary or journaling application. In memorTree, the app, memories are stored as petals on the user's tree. Trees grow as users continue to journal and new petals are needed to store new memories.

Current research suggests there are many benefits of journaling, such as improving mental health, creativity, and emotional intelligence. Keeping a log of thoughts and experiences can improve everyone's well-being. memorTree will not only offer a simple and calming environment to journal but also positive reinforcement and the reward of nourishing a tree that represents the user's own memories.
